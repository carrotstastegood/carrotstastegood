## hi!

i mainly code in python and c++. <br>
i often have trouble coming up with project ideas, let alone useful ones, and i
often abandon projects that i do start. thats why there is basically nothing here
hopefully i can make something interesting here soon.
<br>
im trans, and lesbian. currently im really into deltarune.<br>
